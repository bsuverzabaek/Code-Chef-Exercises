# Divisible Pairs

Given N and M Dexter wants to know how many pairs a,b (1 <= a < b <=N) are there such that (a+b) is divisible by M. 
For example when N=4 and M=3, there are 2 possible pairs the sum of which is divisible by M and they are (1,2) and (2,4).

## Input

- First line of input contains T, which is the number of test cases. 
- Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and M.

## Output

Output one line per testcase, the number of pairs (a,b) as described before.

## Constraints

- 1 <= T <= 100000
- 1 <= N <= 10^9
- 2 <= M <= 10^9

## Example

### Input:

3

2 3
