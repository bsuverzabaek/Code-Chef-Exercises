# Cherry and Bits

Cherry has a binary matrix A consisting of N rows and M columns. The rows are numbered from 1 to N, columns are numbered from 1 to M. 
Element at row i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and column j (1 ≤ j ≤ M) is denoted as A<sub>ij</sub>. All elements of A are either 0 or 1.

He performs Q queries on matrix. 
Each query is provided by four integers x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> which 
define the rectangle, where (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) stands for the coordinates of the top left 
cell of the rectangle, while (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) stands for the coordinates of the bottom right cell. 
You need to flip all the bits i.e. (0 to 1, 1 to 0) that are located fully inside the query rectangle.

Finally, print the matrix after performing all the queries.

Note: x<sub>1</sub> represents the row number while y<sub>1</sub> represents the column number.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains two integers N and M — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.
- Each of the next N lines contains a string of length M, where the j<sup>th</sup> character of i<sup>th</sup> line denotes the value of A<sub>i,j</sub>.
- Next line contains an integer Q — the number of queries.
- Then follow Q lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains four space-seperated 
integers x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> — coordinates of the up left and bottom right cells of the query rectangle.

## Output

Print the matrix, in the form of N strings, after performing all the queries.

## Constraints

- 1≤N,M≤1000
- 0≤A<sub>ij</sub>≤1
- 1≤Q≤10<sup>6</sup>
- 1≤x<sub>1</sub>≤x<sub>2</sub>≤N
- 1≤y<sub>1</sub>≤y<sub>2</sub>≤M

1 1 1 1

2 2 2 2

1 1 2 2 

### Output:

01

10

## Explanation

### Case 1

After processing the 1st query 1 1 1 1, matrix becomes:



After processing the 2nd query 2 2 2 2, the matrix becomes:



After processing the 3rd query 1 1 2 2, matrix becomes:



We need to output the matrix after processing all queries.
