Everyone loves short problem statements.

Given a function f(x) find its minimum value over the range 0<x<π/2

f(x)=(x<sup>2</sup>+b*x+c)/sin(x)

## Input

- First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two real numbers b,c.

## Output

For each test case, output the minimum value of f(x) over the given range. 
Absolute error of 10<sup>−6</sup> is allowed.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤100000
- 1≤b,c≤20

## Example

### Input:

1

2 2

### Output:

5.8831725615
