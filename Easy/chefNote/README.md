The ith line of the next N lines contains two space-separated 
integers P<sub>i</sub> and C<sub>i</sub>, denoting the number of pages and price of the ith notebook respectively.

## Explanation

### Case 1

In this case, Chef wants to write X = 3 pages long poetry, but his notebook has only Y = 1 page. 
And his budget is K = 2 rubles, and there are N = 2 notebooks in the shop. 
The first notebook has P<sub>1</sub> = 3 pages, but Chef cannot buy it, because its price is C<sub>1</sub> = 4 rubles. 
The second notebook has P<sub>2</sub> = 2 pages, and its price is C<sub>2</sub> = 2 rubles. 
Thus Chef can select the second notebook to accomplish the task. 
He will write 1 page of poetry in the old notebook, and 2 page of poetry in the new notebook.

### Case 2

Chef cannot buy any notebook, because the prices exceed the Chef's budget.

### Case 3

No notebook contains sufficient number of pages required to write poetry.
