# Vaccine Distribution

Finally, a COVID vaccine is out on the market and the Chefland government has asked 
you to form a plan to distribute it to the public as soon as possible. 
There are a total of N people with ages a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>N</sub>.

There is only one hospital where vaccination is done and it is only possible to vaccinate up to D people per day. 
Anyone whose age is ≥80 or ≤9 is considered to be at risk. 
On each day, you may not vaccinate both a person who is at risk and a person who is not at risk. 
Find the smallest number of days needed to vaccinate everyone.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>N</sub>.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest required number of days.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤10
- 1≤N≤10<sup>4</sup>
- 1≤D≤10<sup>5</sup>
- 1≤a<sub>i</sub>≤100 for each valid i

## Example

### Input:

2

10 1

10 20 30 40 50 60 90 80 100 1

5 2

9 80 27 72 79

### Output:

10

3

## Explanation

### Case 1

We do not need to worry about how the people are grouped, since only one person can be vaccinated in a single day. 
We require as many days as there are people.

### Case 2

There are two people at risk and three people who are not at risk. 
One optimal strategy is to vaccinate the two people at risk on day 1 and the remaining three on the next 2 days.
