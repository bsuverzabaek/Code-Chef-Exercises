# Guddu on a Date

Guddu likes a girl that loves playing with numbers. 
She agreed to go on a date with Guddu, but only if he can solve the following problem:

and the sum of its digits in decimal representation is a multiple of 10. 
Find the N-th smallest round integer.

However, Guddu does not like playing with numbers at all and he is unable to solve this problem, so he begs you to solve it for him. 
In return, he will definitely give you a treat.
