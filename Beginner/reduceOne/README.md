# Reduce to One

You have become good friends with Chef. Right now, Chef is busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to solve a problem for him.

Consider a list of integers L. Initially, L contains the integers 1 through N, each of them 
exactly once (but it may contain multiple copies of some integers later). The order of elements in L is not important. 
You should perform the following operation N−1 times:

Choose two elements of the list, let's denote them by X and Y. These two elements may be equal.
Erase the chosen elements from L. Append the number X+Y+X⋅Y to L. At the end, L contains exactly one integer. 
Find the maximum possible value of this integer. 
Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (10<sup>9</sup>+7).

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible value 
of the final number in the list modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤100,000 
- 1≤N≤1,000,000

## Example

### Input:

3

1

2

4

### Output:

1

5

119

## Explanation

### Case 1

L=[1]

### Case 2

L=[1,2]→[1+2+1⋅2]
 
### Case 3

L=[1,2,3,4]→[2,3,9]→[3,29]→[119]. The chosen elements in each step are in bold.
