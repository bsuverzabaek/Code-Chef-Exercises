# Roots of a Quadratic Equation

Write a program to take the values for A, B, C of a quadratic equation A*X<sup>2</sup>+B*X+C=0 and then find all the roots of the equation. 
It is guaranteed that A ≠ 0 and that the equation has at least one real root.

## Input

- First line will contain the value of A
- Second line will contain the value of B
- Third line will contain the value of C

## Output

Output two lines. First line contains the value of root 1 (x1) and second line contains the value of root 2 (x2). 
Your output will be considered to be correct if the difference between your output and the actual answer is not more than 10<sup>−6</sup>.
