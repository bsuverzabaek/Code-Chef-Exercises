# K Fibonacci

Chef recently had been studying about Fibonacci numbers and wrote a code to print out the kth term of the Fibonacci series(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13….). 
He was wondering whether he could write a program to generate the kth term for similar series. 
More specifically : T(n, k) is 1 if n <= k and T(n, k) = T(n-1, k) + T(n-2, k) + T(n-3, k) … + T(n-k, k) if n > k. 
Given n and k output T(n, k)%(1000000007) as the answer could be very large.

## Input

Two integers, N and K

## Output

One integer, the nth term of the series mod 1000000007

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup>

## Example

### Input:

7 5

### Output:

9

## Explanation

### Case 1

The series is as follows {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 9}
