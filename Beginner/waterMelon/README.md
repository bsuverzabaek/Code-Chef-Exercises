Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is 0.

You have a sequence of integers A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,…,A<sub>N</sub>. 
You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). 
In one operation, you should choose a valid index i and decrease A<sub>i</sub> by i. 
Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,…,A<sub>N</sub>.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the string "**YES**" if it is possible to make 
the given sequence good or "**NO**" if it is impossible.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤1,000
- 1≤N≤10
- |A<sub>i</sub>|≤100 for each valid i

## Example

### Input:

2

1

-1

2

1 2

### Output:

NO

YES

## Explanation

### Case 2

We can perform two operations ― subtract 1 from A<sub>1</sub> and 2 from A<sub>2</sub>.
